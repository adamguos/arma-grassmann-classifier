The problem of classification of time series arises in many applications of signal processing and
machine learning, e.g., audio/video signal processing, and EEG signal processing. We investigated
novel solutions to some of these problems.

We focused on two approaches to extracting relevant features from the data for classification. The
first is the method of extracting the instantaneous frequencies in the signal using the signal
separation operator (SSO), developed by Chui and Mhaskar. The second is a method of representing the
data on a Grassmann manifold by parametrising it using a dynamic model. We trained support vector
machines with appropriate kernels for classification on these extracted features.

We performed tests on several publicly available datasets, and found that the SSO approach performed
well on time series with low dimensional feature space, whereas the manifold approach took better
advantage of high dimensional representations. This investigation demonstrates the effectiveness of
frequency-based preprocessing in machine learning applications, as well as the ability of data based
manifold techniques in improving upon the performance of existing algorithms.

With this project, I gained familiarity with developing techniques in the fields of manifold
learning, signal processing and function approximation. The project enhanced my understanding of
novel algorithms for machine learning, encouraging me in my career goal to do further research in
these directions.
