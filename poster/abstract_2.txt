The problem of classification of time series arises in many applications of signal processing and
machine learning, e.g., audio/video signal processing, and EEG signal processing. We investigated
novel solutions to some of these problems.

We focused on a novel method of extracting features from the data for classification. We represent
each time series as a point on a Grassmann manifold by parametrising it using the
autoregressive-moving average model. We then trained support vector machines with appropriate
kernels for classification on said Grassmann manifold.

We performed tests on several pubilcly available datasets, and found that an SVM with an appropriate
kernel on the Grassmann manifold consistently performs better than an SVM using a typical Gaussian
kernel that acts on the data in Euclidean space. Furthermore, we found that the Grassmann SVM
technique overperforms the literature in some high-dimensional datasets, without the need for any
other preprocessing techniques. This investigation demonstrates the power of data-based manifold
techniques in improving the performance of existing algorithms.

With this project, I gained familiarity with developing techniques in the fields of manifold
learning, signal processing and function approximation. The project enhanced my understanding of
novel algorithms for machine learning, encouraging me in my career goal to do further research in
these directions.
